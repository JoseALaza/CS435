# CS435

## Course Description:
This is a senior-level course on data-structures and algorithms, with an 
emphasis on algorithm design techniques and analysis of algorithms. Topics include analysis of 
algorithms, worst-case and average-case analysis, induction, recursion, recurrence relations,  
divide-and-conquer design technique, priority queues, hash tables, binary-search trees, balanced 
search trees (AVL trees and red-black trees), sorting and selection algorithms; other design 
techniques such as greedy-method and dynamic-programming, graph algorithms, and 
introduction to number theory and cryptography.
